# Servo-soldier
Actual Battle Scenes in Pawankhind. I developed  real time  scenarios with an Arduino Uno and servo motors.Â  The project utilizes Arduino boards to control servo motors, enabling real-time depiction of soldier battle scenes. Algorithms dictate soldier movements such as advancing, retreating, attacking, and defending.
